# Capstone Project: Create a Customer Segmentation Report for Arvato Financial Services
In this project, I analyzed demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population. I used unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company. Then, I used supervised machine learning techniques to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company.  Finally the results were summarized in a Medium blog post found here: https://medium.com/@ursulahneumann/2-ways-to-use-machine-learning-to-identify-customers-d33c5c2eaf60?postPublishedType=initial.
